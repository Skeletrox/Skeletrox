# 👋 Hi, I'm Sriram Venkatachalam Ramaswamy

**Software Engineer** | **Systems Programming** • **DB Internals** • **Distributed Systems**

I build reliable, efficient systems that push the limits of performance and scalability.  
My background is in **database internals**, **distributed machine learning** and **C++ systems engineering**, and I'm currently exploring distributed systems and storage in Rust to get adept with both these things.

## ⚙️ Current Work
- 🦀 Building a **distributed key-value store in Rust**
- 🚀 Growing as a **technical leader** and **system designer**

## 💼 Professional Experience
I’ve worked on **core database internals** for **AWS Redshift**, focusing on **query execution**, **storage engines**, and **high-performance C++ systems**.  
My work spans **low-level optimization**, **parallel processing**, and **scalable infrastructure** — where correctness and performance both matter.
