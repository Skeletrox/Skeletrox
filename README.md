# 👋 Hi, I'm Sriram Venkatachalam Ramaswamy

**Software Engineer** | **Systems Programming** • **DB Internals** • **Distributed Systems**

I build reliable, efficient, distributed systems that are smart and self-healing.
My background is in **database internals**, **distributed machine learning** and **C++ systems engineering**, and I'm currently exploring distributed systems and storage in Rust to get adept with both these things.
